Issue summary

Our team developed a travelling website by the name "travelo.com", I was incharge of the project data and server flow. I handed over the project to the client with a website warranty of 6 months. 3 months in our furious client called us on issues affecting the system, the website was buggy with wrong delivery of location and time and  dates plus slow response time.

Timeline

November 28th 2020
- Too much traffic to the website slowed down response time of the API delivery of customer needs and the servers were frying up with overload pf the CPU

November 30th 2020
- Website crushed at peak hours 5pm to 10pm
- Poor ratings of the websites slow response time
- SQL data needed to be reviewed due to wrong delivery of location, time and date

December 10th, 2020
- Implemented correct SQL data, updated the load balancer, fresher API codes and new servers to lower slow down of the servers

Root cause and Resolutions

We bought less servers with the report given for clients ranging to 5000 a day but the unprecidented traffic meant more load on the server therefore slow response time. I solved this solution by budgetting for more servers and a better load balancer to curb the over load. We then had to update a fresh version of the SQL code with correction on the affected programmes on location, time and date with fresher website look and implementing other unseen bugs and add a new calculation section to the website as a peace token to the client

Correct and Preventive measures

We put a more stable load balancer, with a cloud monitoring system to check the stability of the servers and SQL was corrected with the right data
